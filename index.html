"The great idea of constructive type theory is that there is no distinction between programs and proofs&#x2026; Theorems are types (specifications), and proofs are programs"
(Robert Harper)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This guide is based on Carnagie Mellon's new curriculum, for reasons why they rewrote it from scratch see Robert Harper's <a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/intro-curriculum-update/%20">blog</a> and his follow up <a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/the-dog-that-didnt-bark/">post</a> on the success of the new material.
The goal of this guide is to build up to a senior undergrad level in theoretical computer science with the necessary rigorous background to understand academic papers in journals to continue self-learning.  
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Accreditation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Why not get an accredited degree so you can pursue graduate studies later or just for extra motivation to complete the material. Combine the free theoretical material here with any of the below programs.  
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/programs/cs/">University of The People</a> offers a fully online, US Distance Education Accrediting Commission(DEAC) accredited BSc in Computer Science that is tuition free. You pay $60 to enroll, and $100 per proctored exam so ~4k USD for a 4 year degree and they offer financial assistance.
They have 5 terms per academic year, with F/T students taking 2 courses per term or P/T students taking 1 course per term. In total there are 40 proctored exams, and you can either ask somebody to be an exam proctor, or use a service like ProctorU, or just look up local universities in your
area they often offer this service. The material is all text based taken online, and both NYU and Berkeley will accept UoP courses for transfer into their BSc programs.   
</p>

<p>
Other online CompSci BSc degrees include Open University in the UK/EU, University of Illios, Arizona State, University of Florida, and the nonprofit Western Governor's University (wgu.edu). OU has some excellent Applied Mathematics degrees, 
such as the <a href="http://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/qualifications/q36">Applied Math w/Statistics</a> BSc(Hons) if you want to take mathematics instead, using the material here for your theory of computation interests. 
</p>

<p>
If you choose to enroll in any of the above, be sure to read Cal Newport's <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/how-to-win-at-college/">college guide</a> to learn how to succeed by managing time and strategies for studying, such as <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/04/08/work-accomplished-time-spent-x-intensity/">Work Accomplished = Time x Intensity</a>.

<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> How Long Will This Take?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Depends on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem">daily effort</a>. Each entry is typically a class with about one semester worth of material and a regular undergrad student at any university will take <a href="https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/content/sample-undergraduate-course-sequence">5 courses</a> per semester with lectures 3 days a week for each course, and be assigned large projects plus multiple extra readings. Often these readings are entire texts, with the warning "exam questions from the assigned reading are fair game".
Just make a commitment for a few hours a day and see how far you get after a year. The most difficult part will be gaining mathematical maturity and doing the preliminaries, as you will not be used to doing hard work and concentration, the rest will be much easier. Because this guide almost exclusively uses functional programming you will write far less code and be able to complete a book like <i>Parallel and Sequential Algorithms</i> in one semester which would be impossible in an imperative language.
The "functional" part in functional programming refers to mathematical functions, meaning functions where each input has a single output. This property then gives you referential transparency, immutability, and equational reasoning.

<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Build a Library (if you can't, use library genesis)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
If you can, buy these books and start building yourself a library. Abe Books often has used copies, or global editions you can buy at significant discount. You will want them around for reference and it's good for motivation, 
you get books off your desk and into the display shelf and have a physical reference for your accomplishments. It also saves your eyes from the strain of screens. If you can't afford these then try libgen.io (Library Genesis) to get a pdf/epub.

<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> How to Succeed</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
This anecdote by Cal Newport on how he was able to get the <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2008/11/25/case-study-how-i-got-the-highest-grade-in-my-discrete-math-class/">best grade</a> in his Discrete Mathematics class involved him practicing proving every theorem given in the lectures and assigned reading 
over and over until he could comfortably pick randomly through his notes and prove something without assistance. The more <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2010/01/06/the-grandmaster-in-the-corner-office-what-the-study-of-chess-experts-teaches-us-about-building-a-remarkable-life/">deliberate practice</a> you can do by completing the exercises and problem sets the 
faster you will complete this curriculum, since you will be able to skip review chapters and will spend less time working on problems as you will have gained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity">mathematical maturity</a>.  
</p>

<p>
You may also want to learn to use emacs org-mode to organize your time. I found it essential to keep track of tasks and even for taking notes, since you can directly paste in code, slides and pdfs. Try some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=emacs+org+mode">tutorials</a>. 
</p>

<p>
On Isaac Newton self-learning geometry:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"He bought Descartes' Geometry and read it by himself .. when he was got over 2 or 3 pages he could understand no farther, than he began again and got 3 or 4 pages father till he came to another difficult place, than he began again and advanced farther and continued so doing till he made himself master of the whole without having the least light or instruction from anybody"

<p>
This is a waste of time if you just watch lectures, and try one or two exercises. You will get the illusion of learning. Do as many exercises as possible, and if the course page has old exams and quizzes absolutely
do them. Teaching Assistants (TAs) exist in universities to give guidence to students correcting their errors and answer questions, which you don't have access to so use <a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/">stack exchange</a> instead. The only way to become an expert is learning from other experts.

The <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">Little Schemer series books</a> are a Q&amp;A format/Socratic method for learning the basics of computation (read the Preface of each book). You can do the Little Schemer with pencil and paper in 3 to 5 sittings. These are great books,
the first in the series is <i>The Little Schemer</i> which teaches you the basics of recursion. The second is the <i>Seasoned Schemer</i>, a book on higher-order functions which will come in handy when you do the Parallel Algorithms book later. The <i>Reasoned Schemer</i> is a great
book for learning relational programming (databases). The <i>Little Prover</i> will drill inductive proofs, excellent for when you take 15-150 Principals of Functional Programming. There is even <i>A Little Java book</i> to teach you the OOP paradigm should you ever find yourself 
in need to learn Java.

<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Repair Your Deficiencies in Elementary Math</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
The best way to fix all your deficiencies in algebra is to jump into a first year calculus text and complete all the exercises. If you get stumped, refer to material such as Sheldon Axler's <a href="http://precalculus.axler.net/">Precalculus</a> book as it includes a solutions manual, where exercises are fully worked out instead of just providing a magic answer, also ask
questions/search math.stackexchange.com, or hire a tutor from a local university. The reason why all universities dump incoming students into three semesters of calculus is it's the best solution for reteaching math to students since they undoubtedly learned it incorrectly in most high schools. A typical first year
course will use the text <i>Calculus: Early Transcendentals</i> by Stewart which covers Single Variable, Multi-Variable and Differential Equations. I used Thomas' book instead, but it doesn't matter what text you use. What you want to be able to do is understand future material in this guide, such as the
summation notation in 15-213 Computer Systems to describe Two's Compliment, proofs by induction used in 15-150 Functional Programming and in discrete math texts, understand amortized analysis, and calculus is also worth knowing for it's own sake as the fundamental theorem of calculus is a major breakthrough in terms of cultural importance
and heavily used in all engineering disciplines and for finance and AI (stats), probability (integration), optimization (differentiation), estimation, ect. Stewart's book has everything you need to do this or Thomas' text.

Math 2400/2410 course follows Spivak's book <i>Calculus</i>, which introduces students to single variable calculus done rigorously. This will be hard to do by yourself, you'll need to ask questions on stack exchange or hire a tutor even with the 3rd version solution guide available, as some of the
exercises are truly difficult. The preface of the course notes Honors Calculus, titled <i>Spivak and Me</i> detailing the writer's history of trying to teach Spivak to freshman students will explain how difficult the book can be. 
</p>

<p>
The MIT course covers Apostol's book, which provides an absolute thorough drilling in university level mathematics for anybody who needs to clear up their skills in basic algebra. It's much more formal with definition, theorem, proof type style but this is how most math texts at this level are written. My recommendation is if you have been out of school for a while, or you struggle with math,
do Apostol's two books and leave no exercises unfinished. I credit slogging through the first volume's exercises in building my mathematical maturity to a level where I could manipulate equations in later courses without making mistakes, even if some of the exercises do become tedious, you'll thank yourself later when trig identities and algebra manipulation become second nature.

 "So I went to Case, and the Dean of Case says to us, it’s a all men’s school, “Men, look at, look to the person on your left, and the person on your right. One of you isn’t going to be here next year; one of you is going to fail.” So I get to Case, and again I’m studying all the time, working really hard on my classes, and so for that I had to be kind of a machine.
 In high school, our math program wasn’t much, and I had never heard of calculus until I got to college. But the calculus book that we had was (in college) was great, and in the back of the book there were supplementary problems that weren’t assigned by the teacher. So this was a famous calculus text by a man named George Thomas (second edition), and I mention it especially because it was one of the first books published by Addison-Wesley, and I loved this calculus book so much that later I chose Addison-Wesley to be the publisher of my own book.
 Our teacher would assign, say, the even numbered problems, or something like that (from the book). I would also do the odd numbered problems. In the back of Thomas’s book he had supplementary problems, the teacher didn’t assign the supplementary problems; I worked the supplementary problems. I was scared I wouldn’t learn calculus, so I worked hard on it, and it turned out that of course it took me longer to solve all these problems than the kids who were only working on what was assigned, at first. 
 But after a year, I could do all of those problems in the same time as my classmates were doing the assigned problems, and after that <i>I could just coast in mathematics, because I’d learned how to solve problems</i>"

"[Computer science] is not really about computers - and it's not about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petri dishes&#x2026;and geometry isn't really about using surveying instruments. Now the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use."

This covers computer architecture from a programmer's perspective, such as how to write cache friendly code, and other optimizations for the x86-64 arch. You learn how to manually write loops in assembly 
and see how recursion works at the lowest abstraction. You learn machine code instructions, return oriented programming to bypass stack protections, the memory hierarchy, and networks. You could read K&amp;R's 
<i>The C Programming Language</i> for a brief intro, though this course will explain C as you go anyway and fully covers pointers at the assembly language level.

This is optional but recommended to see the possibilities of abstraction you can attain within a language like Lisp (scheme). There's a package manager <a href="http://dustycloud.org/misc/talks/guix/chicagolug_2015/guix_talk.html">Guix</a> and distro GuixSD. You configure packages, or your entire system with one text file using a declarative DSL, and can create full dependency graphs for exact reproduction on any other system.
You can create containers that do not require taking large snapshot disc images to keep track of state. GuixSD uses a scheme init system (GNU Shepherd), which means you get all the advantages of Guile Scheme's libraries/API and can completely abstract your system (or hundreds of servers) as just data to be manipulated in a program if you wanted. SICP also fills in any first year CompSci gaps.

If you feel at this level there are gaps in your mathematical understanding, there is these scribed lecture <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/toolkit13/">notes</a> that give you a diverse background in math useful for theoretical CS. There is also the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i/">book series</a> <i>Analysis I &amp; II</i> by Terence Tao 
to fill the gaps, you start at the very beginning, building up the naturals and reals. This <a href="http://bass.math.uconn.edu/real.html">book</a> <i>Real Analysis for Graduate Students</i> by Richard Bass is a crash course in graduate Analysis/Probability/Topology that can help fill those gaps as well.

<p>
If you want to improve your skills in programming, find a large open source project somewhere with active users, write a feature, then accept feedback from the users and more experienced project members. Repeat. 
Keep repeating until you build up your skills in reasoning and writing for programs people actually use. You could also <a href="https://triplebyte.com/">get a job</a> and learn directly from senior programmers. Jane Street Capital is a finance tech company that hires functional programmers 
worldwide, you may want to <a href="https://blogs.janestreet.com/interviewing-at-jane-street/">apply</a> there, or any bio research lab would welcome your skills after completing the <i>Parallel &amp; Sequential Algorithms</i> book. The test/debug methology of most industry programming consistently produces piles of junk software, so there are 
numerous opportunities to apprentice as a <a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/careers/current-vacancies/security-consultant/">security researcher</a>.
