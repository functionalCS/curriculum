This is a collection of modern resources on various undergrad level computer science topics, for someone with an interest in theory. Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis">LibGen</a> if you can't buy these books. You don't have to do everything here, just the topics of interest to you.
If for any reason you want a condensed version, watch the <a href="#sec-5-3">Theory of Computation</a> lectures to see what interests you in the field. Almost all the material in each resource is self contained so will cover necessary background which if you don't have see the <i>preliminaries</i>.

On Isaac Newton's iteration method to self-learn geometry:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"He bought Descartes' Geometry and read it by himself .. when he was got over 2 or 3 pages he could understand no farther, than he began again and got 3 or 4 pages father till he came to another difficult place, than he began again and advanced farther and continued so doing till he made himself master of the whole without having the least light or instruction from anybody"

The <a href="https://htdp.org/">book</a> <i>How to Design Programs (HtDP)</i> has proven success teaching an introduction to programming while remaining rigorous. One of it's authors is now running a public school curriculum project called <a href="https://www.bootstrapworld.org/index.shtml">Bootstrap</a> and gave a <a href="https://youtu.be/5c0BvOlR5gs">talk</a> why this style of teaching programming has the most success, and how it's curriculum transfers to other fields such as
how the students writing games are actually writing differential equations, as the behavior of a game over time is the integral. If you really want to understand programming you should start with this book. If you liked HtDP, it's sequel is <a href="https://papl.cs.brown.edu/2018/index.html">PAPL</a> (original <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/">Racket</a> version also exists, but Pyret and Racket are essentially the same languages just the author was tired of parenthesis complaints from other professors). 
A very rigorous introduction exists as the classic MIT book <i>Structural Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> <a href="#sec-10">(SICP)</a> but the more programming you do before reading SICP, the more you get out of it.

It's possible to do (or at least model) every course in this list using Common Lisp, such as building your own domain-specific <a href="https://www.pvk.ca/Blog/2014/03/15/sbcl-the-ultimate-assembly-code-breadboard/">machine code</a> while completing 15-213 <i>Computer Systems</i>, or hacking together <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/fset/Site/FSet-Tutorial.html">purely</a> functional <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/funds/funds.pdf">data structures</a>, or writing your own pattern matcher, or simulating a turing machine, ect.  
Of course you will do the courses using their recommended languages and tools, but in addition to this, building your own toy prototypes for the topics here in Lisp can help you learn this material as you discover it for yourself with active learning. 
Another shill for Common Lisp as a good language choice is it hasn't changed much in decades, so an old library you found that hasn't been updated in 15 years will still work. There is also the joy of programming Lisp as a <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/#lisp-as-a-system">system</a>.

The <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">Little Schemer series</a> books are a Q&amp;A format/Socratic method for learning the basics of computation (read the Preface of each book). You can do the Little Schemer with pencil and paper in a weekend though the authors recommend at least 3 sittings. The first in the series is <i>The Little Schemer</i> which teaches you to think recursively.
The second is the <i>Seasoned Schemer</i> covering higher-order functions, which will help understand calculus. The differential operator is a higher-order function: given a function on the real line it yields its first derivative as a function on the real line.

<li>Self contained but will make much more sense if you've already done the first book,  <i>The Little Schemer</i> covering cons, lists and recursion. 
</li>
<li>Teaches you to think recursively, and provides an introduction to the principles of types, computation, and program construction.

 "So I went to Case, and the Dean of Case says to us, it’s a all men’s school, “Men, look at, look to the person on your left, and the person on your right. One of you isn’t going to be here next year; one of you is going to fail.” So I get to Case, and again I’m studying all the time, working really hard on my classes, and so for that I had to be kind of a machine.
 In high school, our math program wasn’t much, and I had never heard of calculus until I got to college. But the calculus book that we had was (in college) was great, and in the back of the book there were supplementary problems that weren’t assigned by the teacher. So this was a famous calculus text by a man named George Thomas (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HJTYVOE94R83/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0201077795">second edition</a>), and I mention it especially because it was one of the first books published by Addison-Wesley, and I loved this calculus book so much that later I chose Addison-Wesley to be the publisher of my own book.
 Our teacher would assign, say, the even numbered problems, or something like that (from the book). I would also do the odd numbered problems. In the back of Thomas’s book he had supplementary problems, the teacher didn’t assign the supplementary problems; I worked the supplementary problems. I was scared I wouldn’t learn calculus, so I worked hard on it, and it turned out that of course it took me longer to solve all these problems than the kids who were only working on what was assigned, at first. 
 But after a year, I could do all of those problems in the same time as my classmates were doing the assigned problems, and after that <i>I could just coast in mathematics, because I’d learned how to solve problems</i>"

Start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po-Shen_Loh">Po-Shen Loh's</a> new site <a href="https://www.expii.com/">Expii</a>.com which presents topics in a brief intuitive manner, then feeds you problems in that domain and makes decisions based on your answers if you need more practice problems. The Advanced Topics have all kinds of great tutorials on CS Theory as well as Number Theory.
While you go through Expii, do a survey of The <a href="https://betterexplained.com/ebook/math/">Better Explained</a> Math and Calculus series books, which explain basic math such as the natural logarithm.

The "functional" part in functional programming refers to mathematical functions, meaning functions where each input has a single output.  The 2012 version by <a href="http://dlicata.web.wesleyan.edu/">Dan Licata</a> has the best lecture notes, optionally combine with most <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/lect.html">recent</a> course notes. Robert Harper keeps a <a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/intro-curriculum-update/%20">blog</a> and a follow up <a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/the-dog-that-didnt-bark/">post</a> on the success of teaching this course.
SML is used because it's syntax and module system is simple, much like Scheme's easy syntax was once preferred for introductory courses so the complexity of the language gets out of the way and you learn the fundamentals. I would recommend doing CS3110 and using 15-150 as supplementary course notes for learning how to split up work to be run in parallel.

<p>
It is possible in a functional language like ML to do algebra with types, proving two types are isomorphic with the desired properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. It's also possible to abstract Lists and Trees into polynomials, as every polynomial looks like a sum of terms.
As you will learn in 15-150 <i>Principles of Functional Programming</i> "most functional datastructures have constant time access near the outer layer of their structure, ie: the head of a list or the root of a tree. However, access at some random point inside the structure is typically linear since looking at some element of a list is
linear in the length of the list, and looking at some element of a tree is linear in the depth of the tree. Datatype derivatives allow constant time access to the entire structure."

"[Computer science] is not really about computers - and it's not about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators, and biology is not about microscopes and Petri dishes&#x2026;and geometry isn't really about using surveying instruments. Now the reason that we think computer science is about computers is pretty much the same reason that the Egyptians thought geometry was about surveying instruments: when some field is just getting started and you don't really understand it very well, it's very easy to confuse the essence of what you're doing with the tools that you use."

This covers computer architecture from a programmer's perspective, such as how to write cache friendly code, and other optimizations for the x86-64 arch. You learn how to manually write loops in assembly 
and see how recursion works at a lower abstraction. You learn machine code instructions, how compilers work, return oriented programming (ROP) to bypass stack protections, the memory hierarchy, and networks. You could read K&amp;R's 
<i>The C Programming Language</i> for a brief intro, though this course will explain C as you go anyway and fully covers pointers at the assembly language level making it self contained.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
A classic introductory computer science book on thinking about the big picture of programs with abstraction: finding general patterns from specific problems and building programs based on these patterns. An applied example of this is the package manager <a href="http://dustycloud.org/misc/talks/guix/chicagolug_2015/guix_talk.html">GNU Guix</a> and distro GuixSD, which is a GNU implementation of the NixOS <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.4584.pdf">functional software deployment model</a>. 
Package builds, including entire system builds, are declared in one text file. The resulting software deployment is functional: build inputs go in such as compilers, customizations, environments ect, and a reproducible, immutable build comes out with a hashed identifier meaning you 
can do roll backs to previous successful builds. A recent GUixSD feature <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.00833.pdf">gexp</a> (g-expressions) is a good example what can be achieved through syntactic extensions of the Scheme language.

<p>
Unlike a traditional introduction to algorithms and data structures, this puts an emphasis on thinking about how algorithms can do multiple things at once instead of one at a time and ways to design to exploit these properties. It uses a language based analysis model to estimate complexity for abstractions such as garbage collection.
Most of the self learning and discovery is done through the labs, try them.

The typical text for a senior undergrad or graduate course on algorithm analysis is <i>The Design and Analysis of Algorithms</i> by Kozen (1992). This is an excellent book to study with difficult problems well presented and clearly analyzed by Kozen. The Okasaki book (1999), <i>Purely Functional Data Structures</i> gives examples in Standard ML and Haskell.
